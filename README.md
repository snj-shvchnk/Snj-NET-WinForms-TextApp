Dear SimCorp!

Test task is DONE.
I have attach all materials to this archive.
There are
	- Library with logic and abstractions
	- Unit tests for it
	- WinForm simple Application for demo.
	- Release assembly

Task was realy well formed, and it was so unusual and abstract.
Large partial of my attention I had spend on Library.
And you will see it befor we will get availability to talk about it together.
That's all about task.

Wait on feedback and invitation, see you!
Semen Shevchenko.

Dear Semen!

Thank you for your time! We have enjoyed meeting you. Now we would like to move to the next step, of course if you are still interested to proceed, and therefore I’m sending you coding task that you can find below.

Please, provide solution using C#. If you are up to the challenge, you can also try to provide solution using Ocaml, or F# or any other functional programming language, that would be an advantage, but in this case also try to use functional approach.

Write a program (and prove that it works, we expect you to write automated tests) that: Given a text file, count the occurrence of each unique word in the file.

For example; a file containing the string “Go do that thing that you do so well” should find these counts:

1: Go
2: do
2: that
1: thing
1: you
1: so
1: well
